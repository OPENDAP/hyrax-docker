# There are 2 "classes" of startup behavior in this package.
# The old one, the default service named tomcat.service.
# The new named instances are called tomcat@instance.service.
#
# Use this file to change default values for all services.
# Change the service specific ones to affect only one service.
# For tomcat.service it's /etc/sysconfig/tomcat, for
# tomcat@instance it's /etc/sysconfig/tomcat@instance.
